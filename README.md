# dwm - Dynamic Window Manager

This is my build of dwm for FreeBSD.

# Note
---------
I've changed the config.mk file from the orignal to make it work with FreeBSD, but the original config.mk file can be found in the official repository.

## Patches applied
- Alternative Tags.
- Bar Padding.
- PerTag.
- TileGap.

# Installation
--------------------
> make clean install

root permission (sudo or doas) may be require.
